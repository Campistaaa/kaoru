Unfair Advantage
It is considered UNFAIR ADVANTAGE whenever a user creates, uses, offers, promotes, advertises, makes available and/or distributes any of the following:

Bots: Any code and/or software, not expressly authorized, that allows the automated control of activities, or any other feature, e.g. the automated posting of messages to autopick Cards;
Cheats: Methods not expressly authorized, influencing and/or facilitating progress, including exploits of any in-game bugs, and thereby granting you and/or any other user an advantage over other players not using such methods;
Hacks: Accessing or modifying the website in any manner not expressly authorized; and/or
Any code and/or software, that can be used to automate or simulate activities on a person's behalf thereof which changes and/or facilitates progress or other functionality;
We reserve the right to suspend your account temporarily at any time if we believe your account is benefitting from any of the aforementioned or assisting therein.

It is considered FARMING whenever a user manually uses features intensively in order to optimise their progress. This practice is not encouraged, but also not strictly forbidden. We may at our sole discretion suspend temporarily your account at any time if we deem you're abusing the service by doing this.

Addendum - Bot Farms: Servers dedicated for the sole purpose of collectivelly progressing in one or more Discord Bots, or that incentivise mass messaging certain channels to increase odds of a Random Number Generator feature to be favorable to user's progress. Regardless if by manual or automated means.
The above is not allowed and will be penalised accordingly if one comes to our knowledge.
